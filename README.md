```

## Innovative Solution
```
The project began with the acquisition of a diverse and labeled 
dataset of dermatological images. This dataset recognized for its 
quality and relevance, formed the cornerstone of our project. Data 
Augmentation techniques were applied to enhance dataset diversity. 
The modal was created using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), 
why CNN? – CNN plays a Vital role in image-related processes due to 
its ability to automatically extract features, understand spatial 
hierarchies, and be robust to image variations, also offers translation 
invariance and scalability, making it effective for recognizing complex 
patterns.Trained the model using the dermatology dataset,finetuning
it to improve its prediction accuracy. Modal performance and 
reliability are validated by cross-validation and validation sets. A key 
attribute of our model is its ability to provide easily understandable 
explanations alongside its predictions, making it more accessible and 
user-friendly.

```
## Future Scope 
```
Continuous Improvement of the model accuracy through user 
feedback and updated data. To reach a broader audience, working on 
the development of mobile applications ensuring that our 
model(solution) will be accessible through smartphones making it 
convenient and widely available. Reaching rural regions with low 
network features and Medical camp features connecting users with 
healthcare services in underserved regions
```

## Wow Factor
```
Model Can able to predict a wide range of skin diseases, making it a 
valuable tool for dermatological Health. In-Depth Information –
Beyond diagnosis, our model offers detailed explanations that 
encompass the causes, symptoms, risk factors, and treatment plan 
for an identified skin condition
```

## Technical Stack
```
Python serves as a programming language, well-known for its suitability in deep learning, making it fit for working with Neural networks such as CNNs.
Deep Learning Framework – Tensorflow and Keras.
Data Management – Pandas and NumPy for managing and manipulating data.
Image Processing – OpenCV Working with dermatology images
